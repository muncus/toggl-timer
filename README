Time Tracking
=============

Goal
----
create a simple physical interface that lets me record how much time i
spend doing various things.
additional analysis on these things can be done later.

Architecture
------------

* reader - The reader assembly contains an RFID reader. It reads periodically, to
    determine if a tag is present. if the tag is new, it records the current
    time. when the tag is removed, the pedestal prints the tag number, and the
    number of seconds the tag was present.

* toggl.py script - Reads input from the pedestal, maps the tag name to a task
    (as configured within the tags.yaml file) and creates a new task via
    toggl.com's API.

Usage
-----

* plug in the RFID reader assembly, determine which usbserial device it is.
* use stty to configure the serial port for raw reads:
    `stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 raw`
* direct the reader's output to the toggl.py script:
    `cat /dev/ttyUSB0 | python toggl.py -m tags.yaml -k <your api key>`
