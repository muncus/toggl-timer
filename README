Time Tracking
=============

Goal
----
create a simple physical interface that lets me record how much time i
spend doing various things.
additional analysis on these things can be done later.

Architecture
------------

* pedestal - The pedestal contains an RFID reader. It reads periodically, to
    determine if a tag is present. if the tag is new, it records the current
    time. when the tag is removed, the pedestal prints the tag number, and the
    number of seconds the tag was present.

* toggl.py script - Reads input from the pedestal, maps the tag name to a task
    (as configured within the toggl script) and sends the task update to the
    toggl.com site.


Misc.
-----

* idea - use the tags field to include the rfid tag number. that way there's no non-toggl store of this data.
    * allows us to just 'fetch tasks' in the start, build our own data structure for this.
    * could cause problems for tasks updated outside of this method. (could refresh task list before updating)
