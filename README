Time Tracking
=============

Goal
----
create a simple physical interface that lets me record how much time i
spend doing various things.
additional analysis on these things can be done later.

Architecture
------------

* reader - The reader assembly contains an RFID reader. It functions like a
    punch-clock: tag once to start timing, and again (with the same tag) to stop
    timing and ouput tag number and the duration.

* toggl.py script - Reads input from the reader, maps the tag name to a task
    (as configured within the tags.yaml file) and creates a new task via
    toggl.com's API.

Usage
-----

* plug in the RFID reader assembly, determine which usbserial device it is.
* use stty to configure the serial port for raw reads:
    `stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 raw`
* direct the reader's output to the toggl.py script:
    `cat /dev/ttyUSB0 | python toggl.py -m tags.yaml -k <your api key>`
    OR
    `python toggl.py -i /dev/ttyUSB0 -m tags.yaml -k <your api key>`
